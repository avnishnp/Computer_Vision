Obtain camera projection matrices: The function takes two camera projection matrices, P1 and P2, which represent the camera poses in the two views.
 Each camera projection matrix is a 3x4 matrix that combines the intrinsic parameters of the camera (such as focal length and principal point)
  with the extrinsic parameters (rotation and translation) that define the camera's position and orientation in 3D space.

Collect point correspondences: The function takes two sets of 2D point correspondences, track1 and track2, which are arrays of shape (n, 2). 
Each row in track1 corresponds to the 2D coordinates of a point in the first view, and the corresponding row in track2 represents
 the 2D coordinates of the same point in the second view.

 Check correspondence consistency: The code checks if the number of points in track1 and track2 matches.
  If they don't match, it exits the program with an error message. It is important to have a one-to-one correspondence between the points in the two views.


Extract 2D point coordinates: Inside the loop, the 2D coordinates of the current point in each track are extracted as vectors u and v. 
These vectors are augmented with a 1 at the end to represent homogeneous coordinates.
 This is necessary because the projection equations involve homogeneous coordinates.


Compute skew-symmetric matrices: The function vec2skew (not defined in the code snippet) is likely a helper function that converts a 3D vector 
into a skew-symmetric matrix. Skew-symmetric matrices are used to represent cross-product operations in matrix form.
In this step, two skew-symmetric matrices, h1 and h2, are computed by multiplying the augmented vectors u and v with their respective camera projection matrices (P1 and P2).
The resulting matrices have a shape of 2x4.


Build homogeneous linear system: The two skew-symmetric matrices, h1 and h2, are stacked vertically to form a 4x4 matrix h3. 
This matrix represents the homogeneous linear equations relating the 2D and 3D coordinates of the point.


Perform Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): SVD is applied to the matrix h3. It decomposes h3 into three matrices: U, D, and Vt.
 Here, U is a 4x4 orthogonal matrix, D is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values, and Vt is the transpose of a 4x4 orthogonal matrix V.


 Extract 3D coordinates: The last row of Vt (the transpose of V) corresponds to the right singular vector associated with the smallest singular value.
  This vector, denoted by a, represents the homogeneous coordinates of the triangulated 3D point. 
  By dividing the first three elements of a by the fourth element, the code homogenizes the coordinates and obtains the 3D coordinates of the point.
