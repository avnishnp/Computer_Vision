FindMissingReconstruction : identify the points in a 3D point cloud X that are newly added and valid for a new image registration.

ComputeTriangulationError : calculates the averaged nonlinear triangulation error (E) and the vector f for each point in a 3D point cloud X, 
given two camera projection matrices P1 and P2 and a corresponding set of image points b.

Triangulation_nl : performs nonlinear triangulation to refine the 3D points obtained from a initial triangulation. 
It iteratively improves the triangulation by minimizing the triangulation error.

ComputePointJacobian : The ComputePointJacobian function computes the Jacobian matrix of a 3D point X with respect to a camera pose p. 
The Jacobian matrix represents the sensitivity or rate of change of the projected image points with respect to small changes in the 3D point coordinates.

SetupBundleAdjustment :  sets up the data structures required for bundle adjustment optimization.
 Bundle adjustment is a technique used in computer vision and 3D reconstruction to refine the estimated camera poses and 3D points 
 by minimizing the reprojection error between the observed 2D points and the projected 3D points.
