Given a set of corresponding points x1 and x2 in two images, these points are used to construct a set of equations.

Each point correspondence (x1, x2) generates a row of the essential matrix equation. The equation is typically of the form x2^T * E * x1 = 0,
 where x1 and x2 are homogeneous coordinates of the corresponding points.

These equations are collected into a linear system of equations of the form Ax = 0, where A is a matrix constructed from the point correspondences.
if you have a set of N corresponding points, the matrix A will have dimensions (N, 9), and each row of A will be constructed using the coordinates 
of the corresponding points x1 and x2.

The singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied to matrix A. The essential matrix E is obtained by selecting the right singular vector corresponding 
to the smallest singular value.

The obtained E may not satisfy the essential matrix properties (such as having singular values (1, 1, 0)). To enforce these properties, 
the essential matrix undergoes further refinement. This typically involves performing SVD on E, setting the third singular value to 0, and then reconstructing E.

The final essential matrix represents the geometric transformation between the two cameras.
