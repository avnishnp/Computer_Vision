Project Description :

I am working on the plastic dataset from a research project at Northeastern University. The dataset is a set of 6k product images classified into no-plastic, some-plastic, heavy-plastic, and no-image (not a product).

My objectives would be:
1) Develop a Deep learning based CNN model using EfficientNet that can accurately classify the images based on the amount of plastic they contain
2) Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance by their accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score and plot the confusion matrix.
3) Understand the probability distribution obtained after testing on the test data
4) Comprehend the models behavior using techniques like Saliency feature maps
5) Test the robustness of the model by adversarial testing
6) Visualize the distribution using t-SNE plots
